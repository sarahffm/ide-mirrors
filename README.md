# IDE-Mirrors

Tools have a download link, which is often dependent on the operating system. IDE-Mirrors provides a collection of download urls for the tools of [devon-ide](https://github.com/devonfw/ide/). The separate repository allows a quick customization of the urls. 
To create a mirror for a new tool, follow this [guide](https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/devonfw-ide-contribution-getting-started.asciidoc#ide-mirrors).
